# Modeling Invasive Applesnail Movements Using a Neural Network

## Background
Invasive species present a great threat to biodiversity across the globe. They often use the same resources that many native 
species also depend on and even out-compete the native species in some cases. A species of South American applesnail, *P. maculata*, 
has been able to invade Lake Okeechobee, FL and some parts of the fragile Florida Everglades ecosystem relatively easily. Not much
is known about what factors influence the propagation of this species, just that it is very fecund and lays about 2,000 eggs on average.
As a result, it has become much more common than the native Florida Applesnail, which is the *only food source* of the federally 
endangered Everglades snail kite, which presents a problem to the kite's already dwindling population numbers. This is because it is not
clear whether the kite is able to eat and carry the much larger exotic snail. Here, a simple multilayer perceptron is used to predict
whether the exotic or native snail is favored depending on a) the type of emergent vegetation present, b) the air temperature, and c)
the water depth using data collected by the South Florida Water Management District.
